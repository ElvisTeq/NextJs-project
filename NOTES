## Preparing the Project Pages

- Created
  => "index.js" (main page)
  => "./pages/new-meetup/index.js" (Create meetup page)
  => "./pages/[meetupId]/index.js" (Meetup details)

**\*** "index.js" automatically takes the folder name as URL **\***
Ex => "./pages/[meetupId]/index.js"
=> [meetupId] = index.js
